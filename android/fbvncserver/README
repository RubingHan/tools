VNC server for Android
======================

A simple vnc server based on libvncserver.  

Started with original fbvncserver for the iPAQ and Zaurus.
	http://fbvncserver.sourceforge.net/

Modified by Jim Huang <jserv.tw@gmail.com>
	- Simplified and sizing down
	- Performance tweaks

Modified by Steve Guo (letsgoustc)
 	- Added keyboard/pointer input

Modified by Danke Xie (danke.xie@gmail.com)
	- Added input device search to support different devices
	- Some code clean-up


QUICK INSTALL
=============

Copy the directory fbvncserver to any Android build directory, run
a build command from Android root
  $ make -j4 fbvncserver

Push the binary to the device/emulator
  $ adb push system/bin/fbvncserver /data/
  
Modify file permission and run
  $ adb shell
  # cd /data
  # chmod 777 fbvncserver
  # ./fbvncserver
  

INPUT SUPPORT
=============

After Steve Guo's modifications, the fbvncserver can forward input events
from the VNC client to Android. The way it works is converting VNC input
events to keyboard and touchscreen events and send to the input devices
/dev/input/event<N>. 

In this verison, some modifications are added to automatically determine
the <N> values of the keyboard and touchscreen devices. It enumerates the
input devices /device/input/event<N>, and matches the reported device name
against a list of keywords in fbvncserver.c. For example,

static const char *KBD_PATTERNS[] = {"key", "qwerty", NULL};
static const char *TOUCH_PATTERNS[] = {"touch", "qwerty", NULL};

Devices containing the strings in KBD_PATTERNS are recognized as the keyboard,
and those containing strings in TOUCH_PATTERNS are recognized as the touchpad.

If a matched device is not found, the default input device names are used, or
the user can specify by the command line:
	
	-k <keyboard-device-path>
	-t <touchpad-device-path>
	
Information about the input devices can be found in /proc/bus/input/devices.
